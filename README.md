# Chirper Project

This repository is a code-along React-Redux project in the React Nanodegree program by Udacity.

It's a simple clone of the basic functionality to show how the Twitter app works. It uses Redux to manage state and React to control the UI. It was created as pure base for study and trainning.

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.
